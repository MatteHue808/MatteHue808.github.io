Hello everyone! My name is Matthew, but you can just call me Matt. I am currently a junior in the Shidler College of Business at UH Manoa, and I am majoring in Marketing and minoring in English; I do have plans to either double major in MIS or International Business, however. I have a passion for all things related to writing, both fiction and non-fiction, however, I took this class to learn more about programming, its uses, and how to apply it practically for a career after graduation. 

I have many friends from high school and university who are taking computer science, and the things that they create always amaze me. Personally, I would like to create something to aid in my Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaigns - which is a table top roleplaying game you might've first seen in the TV show "Stranger Things" - and also build a website to showcase my writing portfolio. 

I'm not sure whether I want to be a developer, however, I am willing to take a peek. After all, it's always good to build up one's hard skills. It's very nice to meet you all.
